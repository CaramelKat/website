                        <b>Hello World!</b>
                        <p>
                            Hello World! My name is Jemma, if you got here I'm assuming you've either already read my website or already know me :p
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I saw my friend <a href="https://heyquark.com/">Ash</a> recently start blogging again, and I wanted to try getting into
                            it myself (and this definitely isn't an excuse to avoid writing a giant paper due in 2 weeks lol)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>So what do I write about?</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That's where I'm stuck. I have a number of <a href="https://jemsoftware.dev#my-projects">projects</a> that I'm working on,
                            and I'm not sure what I want to write about. So here's what I'm gonna do instead: I'm gonna ramble about some random school
                            assignment I was stuck on recently, and we'll see if I actually keep doing this.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Background Info:</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            While I'm fairly experienced in programing in JS and other web technologies, C++ is not my strong suit. I'm currently in
                            an intermediate software engineering class that has a semester long group project in C++. Our project is using the Steam
                            web API to get information about games, and keep logs about your playtime and showing statistics about your library.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Okay, that's pretty straight forward, what's the problem?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <u>I'm a dumbass</u>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So networking support in C++ is not something I've played around with too much. I once attempted to create a web server on a
                            Wii U (which unfortunately that code is long gone -_-), but aside from that I knew nothing. So I naively googled network
                            requests in C++ and ran into the <a href="https://docs.libcpr.org/">cpr</a> library. Okay, great! Let's just slap and in and call it good and-
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Oh wait. My group members don't have their own PC's to work on the project. So we can't install dependencies on the school computers.
                            (not to mention the fact that we're stuck using Visual Studio & Windows forms, so switching to cmake would be a pain at this point)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>My Implementation:</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At this point I realized that I would likely have to use a built-in system library and started doing some digging. What I came across
                            was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/about-winhttp">WinHTTP</a>, an HTTP/2 interface. It's a pretty neat,
                            it's got support for IPv6 and the WebSocket protocol, but it's extremely high level, so I have to sit down and hammer out my own implementation
                            for GET and POST requests.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I actually got pretty far into my own (frankly terrible) implementation, before running into <a href="https://github.com/shaovoon/winhttp_examples">this</a>
                            example implementation that was better than mine in every way. So took it and turned it into a nice library that I can use in my projects.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So now making requests to the Steam web API is as simple as this:
                            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/azTh25p.png">
                            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rTungIv.png">
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Wrapping Up</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Unfortunately I can't share the source code for any of this at the moment as this is still an in-process assignment, and I'd rather not get
                            myself in trouble. But this was honestly really fun to write (even if it was just a whole lot of nothing) and I do want to write more posts
                            about my personal projects in the future.
                            <br>
